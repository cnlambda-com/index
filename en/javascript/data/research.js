However, the encryption and anonymity of virtual currencies also provide many illegal sellers with technical advantages, such as encrypted crimes, ransomware, money laundering, and so on. Therefore, based on the openness and transparency of transaction records on the chain, we aim to use artificial intelligence, especially the deep learning methods, to mine more information, and to help government agencies as well as the enterprises analyze, understand and supervise the transactions."

However, as the main receiver of pure digital verification codes, SIM cards are easy to be copied. In addition, due to the existence of pseudo signal stations, pure digital verification codes are easy to be hijacked or stolen. Once the thief obtains the random verification code, he can easily crack the identity verification barrier of the payment platform and conduct illegal operations, which brings great risks to mobile payment. While, due to the characteristics of the pure digital verification code, it is difficult for us to enhance its reliability and security."

            "Blockchain layer 2 scaling solutions are aiming to increase the throughput of blockchain and decrease the transaction fee without changing the underlying blockchain structure. The current layer 2 solution such as zk-Rollup, Plasma, Nocust … they share a same idea that a operator over blockchain is introduced to the system, the operator handle users’ transactions and does off-line computations.  These systems are focus on moving vast of the data and computation offline so the blockchain will handle less data, while most of them do not introduce privacy aspect to their system yet. In these system, users’ balance and transaction values are all transparent, which is not desirable for privacy. Privacy and scalability, however, are hard to achieve at the same time. Since adding privacy and confidentiality for a blockchain inevitably adds more computation and data to the blockchain, reducing the transaction throughput and increasing the transaction fees, thus downgrading the scalability of the system. There is always a trade-off between these two aspects."

            "Blockchain is a distributed ledger that is append-only, immutable and public, and it uses a consensus protocol to make every node in the network agree on the same record. While in the traditional blockchain system, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, all the transactions are public, users’ balances and transaction flows are all transparent, which is not desirable for privacy.  Zero-knowledge proof, which is a cryptographic proof system, is widely used for solving these problems. It can hide the secrets that the prover holds while still give proof that the secret satisfies some properties. For example, in Zerocash, a zero-knowledge proof is used to show that a user has a valid coin while other people cannot tell which valid coin this user has. Thus, by using zero-knowledge proof, a user can spend a coin without telling which coin it is; other parties can only tell the coin is from a large collection of valid coins. Apart from the privacy issues on blockchain systems, zero-knowledge can also be used for verified computations. Users can send fewer data and have less computation on-chain to save the cost of the transaction fee, while the computation can still be verified. For example, in ZK-Rollup systems, the zero-knowledge proof is used to make sure that all the off-chain transactions are computed correctly； namely, a prover generates a proof for the off-line transactions and sends it to the blockchain. The blockchain only needs to verify the proof, and it does not need to verify the transaction one by one, thus saving vast computations."
